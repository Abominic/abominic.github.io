      <h2>Dom's Website</h2>
      <p>This is my place where I occasionally put random projects and write things.</p>
      <br>
      <p>There's more coming soon now that I've finished with University and have more free time...</p>
      <br>
      <p>In the meantime check out this <a href="flaggame/">cool flag game</a>.</p>
      <p>I also made a small <a href="https://github.com/Abominic/Domcraft">Minecraft clone</a> in Rust to experiment with graphics and multithreading.</p>
